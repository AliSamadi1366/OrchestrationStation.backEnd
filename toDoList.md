# To-Do List for db folder 

1. Write out the following queries, in separate files:

- users (register, login, get by id, get all)

- instruments (get all, get by id, search/filter, create, update, delete)

- comments ( get by instrument, get by user, add, delete)

- favorites ( get by user, add, remove, check if favorited)

2. Write code to seed database. Remember not to use faker this time, but actual data.
